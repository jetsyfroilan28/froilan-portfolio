# Reflection
   While building my student portfolio website, I encountered several challenges that tested both my technical knowledge and patience. One of the main challenges was organizing the HTML structure while ensuring the layout remained responsive across different screen sizes. At first, the mobile navigation menu didn’t work properly—it either wouldn't open or would cover content awkwardly. I resolved this by incorporating a simple JavaScript toggle function and adjusting the CSS to better handle mobile breakpoints.
    Another issue was managing the modals for the activity cards. Initially, the modals wouldn’t open or close correctly because the JavaScript wasn’t correctly linked or targeting the elements. I solved this by carefully assigning data-modal attributes and ensuring each modal had the appropriate ID and close button functionality. Styling consistency was also a minor challenge. Some sections appeared disconnected in terms of design. I tackled this by defining CSS variables and using a color palette that gave the entire site a more cohesive and visually appealing look. If I were to improve the portfolio in the future, I would focus on adding more dynamic features. For example, integrating a backend (using Firebase or a simple server) to store contact form submissions would make it more practical. I’d also like to optimize image loading and add animations using libraries like AOS or GSAP for a smoother user experience. Lastly, adding a blog or project update section could showcase ongoing learning and growth.
